Managing different versions is one of the important topics in software development. Normally there can only be one version of flutter at a time and switching between the version takes a little bit longer since it downloads the SDK and libraries from the beginning. Hence If we are working on more than one project with different versions then it becomes a little bit hectic to switch versions between the project. In a real scenario, a person might have a lot of projects and it is not assured that they could run into the same flutter version because some projects might need a specific version of Flutter.

In Flutter we can manage different versions of Flutter using FVM aka Flutter Version Management, a simple CLI to manage different Flutter versions on a per-project basis.

Flutter version management is the process of managing and switching between different versions of the Flutter framework. It allows developers to work with specific versions of Flutter to ensure compatibility with their projects and dependencies. One popular package for Flutter version management is "flutter_version" package.

The "flutter_version" package provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool that helps you manage multiple versions of Flutter on your development machine. It allows you to install, switch, and list available Flutter versions with ease. Here are some key features and functionalities of the "flutter_version" package:

Version Installation: The package enables you to install specific versions of Flutter. You can download and set up multiple Flutter versions side-by-side on your machine.

Version Switching: With "flutter_version," you can switch between installed Flutter versions seamlessly. This is useful when you need to work on different projects that require specific Flutter versions.

Version Listing: The package provides commands to list the available Flutter versions installed on your machine. This allows you to see the versions you have installed and choose the desired version to switch to.

Version Locking: "flutter_version" allows you to lock your project to a specific Flutter version. This ensures that your project will use a specific Flutter version regardless of the Flutter version installed on your machine.

Flutter Channel Management: Flutter has different release channels, such as stable, beta, and dev. The package allows you to switch between these channels, making it easier to test your app against different Flutter releases.

By using a Flutter version management package like "flutter_version," you can ensure that your projects are compatible with specific Flutter versions, manage multiple projects with different Flutter requirements, and easily switch between different Flutter releases as needed.

To configure Flutter Version Management (FVM) on macOS, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Install Flutter: If you haven't already, install Flutter on your macOS machine by following the official Flutter installation guide. This will include setting up the necessary environment variables and downloading the Flutter SDK.

2. Install Homebrew: Open a terminal and install Homebrew, which is a package manager for macOS. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. Install FVM: Use Homebrew to install FVM by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   brew install fvm
   ```

4. Configure FVM: After installing FVM, you need to set it up to work with Flutter. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   fvm use --install <version>
   ```
   Replace `<version>` with the desired Flutter version you want to install and use, such as `2.8.0`. This command will install the specified version of Flutter and set it as the default for the current project.

5. Verify FVM Installation: To confirm that FVM is correctly installed and configured, run the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   fvm flutter doctor
   ```
   This command will display the Flutter doctor output specific to the FVM-managed version.

6. Use FVM with Projects: To use FVM with a specific Flutter project, navigate to the project's directory in the terminal and run the following command:
   ```
   fvm use
   ```
   This command will set the Flutter version specified by the `.fvm/fvm_config.json` file in the project directory.

7. Switch Between Flutter Versions: To switch between different Flutter versions, use the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   fvm use <version>
   ```
   Replace `<version>` with the desired Flutter version you want to switch to. This command will update the Flutter version used by the current project.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure Flutter Version Management (FVM) on your macOS machine. FVM provides a convenient way to manage multiple Flutter versions and switch between them seamlessly for different projects.
